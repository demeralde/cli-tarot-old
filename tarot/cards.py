                I know a spiritual approach rarely appears logical and sometimes even seems
                impractical. However, when this card appears, I know I can take a risk and
                trust that with faith, anything is possible! The invisible realms will reveal
                each step along the way. I am meant to experience this regardless of where I
                travel. This is a time where I'm learning that I am a spiritual being having a
                human experience.
